Influencer to Influenza - I Caught her Logic Flu
She once claimed to be an influencer — but for me, she was just influenza in disguise.
It started with a small bet: if I could draw her nicely, she’d send me her childhood photo.
I tried.
I failed — not in life, but in the drawing. 🎨💔
She didn’t send the photo.
Instead, I failed my exam by just 0.25 marks —
not 1, not 10 — just 0.25. 📉
That’s how my suffering began.

She always says, “Everyone deserves something.”
And yet somehow, she excluded me from everyone.
I deserved nothing —
not the photo, not peace, not even a pause button on her logic. 🤒

After that?
We chatted for two nights straight — no sleep, just stubborn talks. 💤💬
Things like:
how her ☕ coffee is smarter than people,
and how 🌕 the moon has feelings too.

She reads horoscopes like they’re science books. 🔮📚
Limited thinking. Unlimited confidence. 🚫🧠🔥

And me?
I caught her flu of confusion. 🤧
No cure. Just regret… and a 0.25 mark heartbreak. 💀

Her logic:

She once said, “You might influence me.”
But clearly, she reset my brain instead. 🧠🔁
And the twist?
She caught her own flu later —
I was just patient zero. 🧪🧍

To this day, I still don’t know who’s more stubborn —
her, the self-declared professor of nonsense,
or me, the unpaid intern who listened to all her stubborn hypotheses and observations... like it was my final thesis. 🎓🤓
